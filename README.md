# gitflow


We want a unified framework for git-cli and gh-cli integrated through neovim. In short, this means, all primative git functionality -- status, add, commit, push, pull, merge, etc., while also having a GitHub inspired interface for managing PRs, merge-conflicts, issues, labels, etc. We want to be able to comment on PRs, create new issues, do code reviews with GitHub like interface (+/-), respond to reviews, etc. etc.

This should be done all in one unified framework, with the ability to sync with gh with a single stroke.

We want the front-end to be traditional neovim themed but state-of-the-art with coloring and theming.

Please create modular issues in a chronological format so we can proceed with getting this going.

It is important to update the readme with a basic configuration + all of the functionalities + binds. The README.md should be concise, not use emojis, and implement a wiki-like thing for functionality + default binds.
